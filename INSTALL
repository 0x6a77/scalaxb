scalaxb installation
====================

scalaxb is tested only under Scala 2.8. 

Installation using Scala Bazaar System (sbaz)
---------------------------------------------

The following downloads and installs the latest shared build of scalaxb
to the sbaz managed directory:

  $ sudo sbaz install scalaxb

Installation from source and sbaz
---------------------------------

Download and install simple-build-tool (sbt) from 

   http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/

The following builds a scalaxb package from the source and installs it
to the sbaz managed directory:

  $ sbt sbaz
  $ sudo sbaz install -f target/scala_2.8.0.Beta1/scalaxb-0.0.2.sbp

The the file name of the scalaxb package may have different version number.

Build from source
=================

The following builds plain jar from source.

  $ sbt package
  
This produces target/scala_2.8.0.Beta1/lib/scalaxb.jar.
The following instructions are copied from simple-build-tool (sbt).

Unix
----

Put the jar in your ~/bin directory, put the line

  java -Xmx512M -jar `dirname $0`/scalaxb.jar "$@"

in a file called scalaxb in your ~/bin directory and do

  $ chmod u+x ~/bin/scalaxb.jar
  
This allows you to launch scalaxb in any directory by typing scalaxb at the
command prompt.

Windows
-------

Create a batch file scalaxb.bat:

  set SCRIPT_DIR=%~dp0
  java -Xmx512M -jar "%SCRIPT_DIR%scalaxb.jar" %*

and put the jar in the same directory as the batch file. Put scalaxb.bat on your
path so that you can launch scalaxb in any directory by typing scalaxb at the
command prompt.
