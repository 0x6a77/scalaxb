scalaxb
=======

scalaxb is an XML data-binding tool for Scala that supports W3C XML Schema (xsd) and
Web Services Description Language (wsdl) as the input file.

From the schema document scalaxb will generate Scala source files containing
case classes to represent the data and typeclass instances to turn XML documents into an object,
and the object back to XML.

Status
------

The latest is 0.6.6. Some things may not work.
I'd really appreciate if you could run it against your favorite xsd
file and let me know the result.

Modules
-------

There are currently four ways of running scalaxb:

- command line app `scalaxb`
