## goodbye sbaz, hello conscript
sbaz allowed quick installation of scalaxb, but it also had its share of problems like scala version dependencies and contaminating the REPL classpath.
Starting 0.6.1, scalaxb will no longer be supporting sbaz and recommend all users to switch to [conscript](https://github.com/n8han/conscript) for installing `scalaxb`.

    $ sudo sbaz remove scalaxb
    $ cs eed3si9n/scalaxb

## no `Array`
- `xs:base64Binary` now maps to `scalaxb.Base64Binary` instead of `Array[Byte]`.
- Both `scalaxb.HexBinary` and `scalaxb.Base64Binary` are backed by `Vector[Byte]` internally.
- Other built-in types that previously mapped to `Array[String]` now maps to `Seq[String]`.

## mvn-scalaxb
[scalaxb plugin for Maven](http://scalaxb.org/mvn-scalaxb) was contributed by [@martiell](http://twitter.com/martiell).

## sbt-scalaxb for sbt 0.10
To call scalaxb from sbt 0.10, put this in your `project/plugins/build.sbt`:

    libraryDependencies += "org.scalaxb" %% "sbt-scalaxb" % "0.6.1"

    sourceGenerators in Compile <+= scalaxb.identity
