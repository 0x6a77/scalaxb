## breaking changes
In an effort to solve namespace conflicts and to increase consistency among the plugins, [sbt plugins best practices](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Plugins-Best-Practices) was created. Here are the changes based on its recommendations:

### keys are under `ScalaxbKeys` object
Keys provided by sbt-scalaxb now resides in `ScalaxbKeys` object. Place the following at the top of your `build.sbt`:

    import ScalaxbKeys._

Scala identifiers for the keys remain the same (e.g. `packageName`), but key names accessible from the shell are now prefixed with `scalaxb-` (e.g. `scalaxb-package-name`).

### settings are scoped under `scalaxb` task and `Compile` configuration
`scalaxb`-specific settings are now scoped under `scalaxb` task and `Compile` configuration, instead of `Scalaxb` configuration.

    packageName in scalaxb in Compile := "ipo"

## bug fixes and minor enhancements
