This is a release candidate for the first stable release of scalaxb.

## breaking changes since 0.7

Some changes were made to adapt to Scala 2.10.0-RC1.

- To avoid implicit conflict, the `scalaxb` package object no longer extends `XMLStandardTypes`.
- `scalaxb.XMLStandardTypes` object was added to support explicitly importing implicits.
- `HexBinary` class and `Base64Binary` class's `toIndexedSeq` method is now a field named `vector`.
- The default http client for SOAP binding is upgraded to [Dispatch 0.9.2](http://dispatch.databinder.net/).
