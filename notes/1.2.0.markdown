## non-blocking SOAP

scalaxb 1.2.0 generates non-blocking SOAP code. Instead of `Either`, now the SOAP call returns `Future[A]` and fault is thrown as `Future`'s failure semantics.

    // default
    def getQuote(symbol: Option[String]): Future[stockquote.GetQuoteResponse]

    // async in scalaxb := false
    def getQuote(symbol: Option[String]): Either[scalaxb.Fault[Any], stockquote.GetQuoteResponse]

This feature was contributed independently by [@jlavallee][@jlavallee] and [@hoff2][@hoff2] as [#213][213]/[#259][259].
